- A lot of things are better in wsl2 than in wsl2, except the performance across OS file systems

* #### problem 

- I didn't turn on the windows hypervisior platform so i had an error like this. 

            Error code:wsl/service/createvm/hcs_e_service_not_available 

- you should check the status of your windows first before you input these instructions. You must turn on the windows hypervisior platform and virtual machine platform before updating.
