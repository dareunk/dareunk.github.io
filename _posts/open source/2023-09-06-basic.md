### Open Source Software(OSS)

OSS is software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, or anything.

- Anyone can distribute the software and use source code for any purpose

- It is free for modification, examination, and redistribution, but not for money


### License

Licenser gives IPRs to licensee 

#### private SW vs Open source SW

* What is difference between private SW and open source SW?

It is the same that licenser gives licensee IPRs, but lincess need to give them loyalty like money. In open source, you just need to follow the requirement from the license


#### categorize of license

* **Permissive** 

1. lenient type
2. They allow anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software, including proprietary software.
3. Even they use open souce, they don't have to share their source code or anything.


* **Weak Copyleft**

1. = LGPL(Lesser General Public License)
2. It's like middle position between permissive and strong copyleft 
3. In modification linked **dynamically**, the source code need to be opened


* **Strong Copyleft**

1. = GPL(General Public License)
2. the most restrictive type of open source license
3. any code interacts with the open souce code in any project, need to be opended 


#### OSS type

|  | free | pay |
|------|-------|--------|
|opened source code | most of oss (Apache, Tomcat) | part of oss(RedHat, Mysql) |
|closed source code | FreeWare(Winzip), Shareware, Adware(JetAudio) | pricate sw(Ms office, Oracle) |

#### Leader

- Open source writer 

- Determine the way of the project

- Make the final desicion, if the project is big, organize the board of trustees and roles as a reader in the group.


#### Maintainer

- Main contributor 

- Required higher skills

- Maintain specific part that is delegated from the leader 

- Make a schedule, review codes, decide about merge 


#### Committer 

- Contribute regularly to the project, and understand codes about specific modules

- Contributer의 기여를 peview 및 승인할 권한이 있음

- 특정 모듈에 대해 Maintainer의 승인을 받지 않고도 merge할 수 있음


#### Contributor

- 누구라도 기여한 사실이 있다면 Contributor

- 꼭 코드를 작성하지 않아도 간단한 문서작성(README.md)등을 작성했다면 Contributor라고 할 수 있음

- Committer 및 Maintainer에 의해 리뷰과정을 거치면서 보완이 된 후 repository에 merge


#### User

- Most important role in open source

- 프로젝트를 사용하면서 버그를 report하거나 새로운 기능에 대한 아이디어를 제공

- If they don't listen to user's opinions, the open source can't be growing up in the long term

- 프로젝트는 사용자의 필요를 충족시키는 방향으로 성장해야 지속가능성이 있음


### Open souce process

two way process (inbound + outbound)
